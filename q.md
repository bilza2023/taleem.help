ok now here is my grand idea but it still connects at ground level
In thousand of institutes every year in pakistan teachers stand infront of broads and explain math physics , etc etc. 
we have discussed the low-singla problem where the teacher is in bad mood or the class is waching cricket etc etc . 
Even if all goes well -- The teacher is writing most of the time-- it takes 50% of the time to write --and then it is accompnied by hotch-potch images  ---
millions of sutdent do their reserch every year and other than some photo-copied notes here and does not remain any thing.
Even in top educational institutes the slides made are not updated and are teching 1990s IT. still in power-point era.

--> now the educational system is ripe for disruption or not -- BUT this is a physical reality that --- this system needs struture --- and automation --- and we should fill this gap
once again what we do  1: low-signal issue 2: Clean graphics which can be viewed again and again and become part of memory (heance 1 year) 3:struture and continuous updates (most updated notes in video form). 
this with good price .
lets take the largest titanic task --> class 9th math --> that is 500 decks -- in 1 week we made 50 test decks -- how far can that be
