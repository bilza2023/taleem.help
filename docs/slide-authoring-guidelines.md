# Taleem Slide Content Guidelines (v1)

This document defines **content density and clarity rules** for slide authoring.

This is separate from `deck-schema.md`.

The schema defines structure.
This document defines cognitive discipline.

---

## 1️⃣ bulletList

**Purpose:** Quick scanning.

**Rules:**

• Minimum: 2 bullets
• Maximum: 6 bullets
• Each bullet must be ONE line
• No bullet should exceed ~12 words
• No punctuation paragraphs
• No multi-sentence bullets
• Bullet must not wrap

If there are more than 6 bullets, the content likely belongs in an `eq` slide.
If a bullet wraps to two lines → split the slide.

---

## 2️⃣ imageLeftBulletsRight / imageRightBulletsLeft

**Purpose:** Visual + reinforcement.

**Rules:**

• Maximum: 6 bullets
• Ideal: 4 bullets
• Each bullet must be short (≤ 10–12 words)
• Bullet must be exactly one line (no wrapping)
• Only one visual idea per bullet
• Image must support the concept, not decorate

If explanation becomes detailed → move to `eq` or `titleAndPara`.

These slides are for clarity, not explanation depth.

---

## 3️⃣ titleAndPara

**Purpose:** Calm explanation.

**Rules:**

• Maximum 6–8 rendered lines
• Avoid dense academic paragraphs
• Prefer 2–3 short paragraph blocks
• No wall-of-text
• If longer → split into two slides

This slide is for reflection and understanding.
It is not for dumping information.

---

## 4️⃣ twoColumnText

**Purpose:** Comparison or contrast.

**Rules:**

• Each column ≤ 5–6 lines
• Left and right must feel visually balanced
• Do not place a full paragraph on one side and a short line on the other
• Avoid dense text

This slide is about symmetry and visual structure.

---

## 5️⃣ eq Slide

**Purpose:** Stepwise reasoning.

This slide is critical.

**Rules:**

• Maximum 6 main lines (`name: "line"`)
• Only one heading per eq slide
• Side panel must contain 4–8 `spItems`
• Avoid 10+ `spItems`
• Each `spText` should ideally be one sentence
• If logical flow exceeds 6 lines → split into next eq slide

EQ slide is controlled reasoning.
It is not a textbook page.

The sample EQ deck is illustrative only.
Its density is not a rule.

---

## 6️⃣ imageSlide / fillImage

**Purpose:** Pause and visual anchor.

**Rules:**

• No text
• Must support the concept
• Never use as filler

These slides control rhythm and breathing space.

---

## 7️⃣ table

**Purpose:** Structured comparison.

**Rules:**

• Maximum 6 rows
• Maximum 4 columns
• If more → split
• Avoid long sentence cells

Tables carry high cognitive load.

---

# Core Principle

Every slide must pass this test:

> Can a 14-year-old process this in 6–8 seconds?

If not → split the slide.

Taleem’s strength is clarity and breathing room.
Information density must never overpower understanding.
