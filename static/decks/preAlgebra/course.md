Perfect, clean and focused 👍
Here’s a **reasonable, tight 20-video structure**. First video sets context, then it’s **one core idea per video**, no fluff.

1. Course Introduction: Why Pre-Algebra Matters
2. Numbers We Use: Natural, Whole, Integers
3. Number Line and Ordering Numbers
4. Factors and Multiples
5. Prime and Composite Numbers
6. HCF and LCM (Concept Only)
7. Fractions: Meaning and Types
8. Equivalent Fractions and Simplification
9. Operations on Fractions (Overview)
10. Decimals: Place Value and Meaning
11. Operations on Decimals
12. Percentages: Meaning and Conversion
13. Ratio and Proportion
14. Powers and Exponents (Basics)
15. Square Roots (Conceptual)
16. Algebraic Notation: Letters as Numbers
17. Simple Expressions (No Solving Yet)
18. Substitution in Expressions
19. Simple Word Problems (Pre-Algebra Style)
20. Bridge to Algebra: What Comes Next

This list has a nice flow:
• foundations → number systems → fractions/decimals → ratios → exponents → algebra thinking
• zero overlap, zero overload
• every item fits cleanly into a short deck

If you’re happy with this, next step could be:
👉 lock the list, then start **video-by-video deck production**, one per session, no overthinking 😄
