<h1>Theorem 11.1.4 – Medians of a Triangle Are Concurrent</h1>

<img src="/images/theorems9old_11.1.4.svg" alt="Triangle with all three medians meeting at G" style="max-width:50%;">

<h2>Book Statement</h2>
<p>The medians of a triangle are concurrent and their point of concurrency is the point of trisection of each median.</p>

<h2>Key Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Median:</strong> A line segment from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.</li>
  <li><strong>Concurrent:</strong> Lines are concurrent if they all meet at a single point (not to be confused with congruent).</li>
  <li><strong>Trisection:</strong> A segment divided into three equal parts; here, the centroid divides each median in a 2&nbsp;:&nbsp;1 ratio (vertex&nbsp;→ centroid : centroid&nbsp;→ midpoint).</li>
</ul>

<p>The centroid is the point of concurrency of the three medians and lies 2 parts from the vertex and 1 part from the midpoint.</p>

<h2>What We Will Prove</h2>
<ol>
  <li>All three medians of a triangle meet at one point (concurrency).</li>
  <li>That point divides each median in a 2&nbsp;:&nbsp;1 ratio.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Detailed Proof</h2>

<h3>Step&nbsp;1 – Build the Parallelogram</h3>
<p>Take triangle <em>ABC</em> and choose two medians: <em>BE</em> and <em>CF</em>. They intersect at point <em>G</em>, our candidate centroid.
Mark a point <em>H</em> on the extension of <em>AG</em> such that <em>AG = GH</em>.  
In triangle <em>ACH</em>, <em>G</em> and <em>E</em> are mid‑points, so by the Mid‑point Theorem <em>GE&nbsp;∥&nbsp;HC</em>.  
In triangle <em>ABH</em>, <em>G</em> and <em>F</em> are mid‑points, so <em>GF&nbsp;∥&nbsp;HB</em>.  
These two pairs of parallels form parallelogram <em>HBCG</em>.</p>

<h3>Step&nbsp;2 – The Third Median Must Pass Through G</h3>
<p>We already formed a parallelogram <em>HBCG</em> inside the triangle. A fundamental property of parallelograms is that their diagonals <strong>bisect each other</strong> — meaning they cut each other exactly in half.</p>
<p>In this case, the diagonals <em>BH</em> and <em>CH</em> intersect at point <em>D</em>, which must be the <strong>midpoint of BC</strong> due to this bisection rule.</p>
<p>Now observe line <em>AD</em>: it connects vertex <em>A</em> to the midpoint <em>D</em> of <em>BC</em>, making it the <strong>third median</strong>.</p>
<p>Crucially, this line also passes through point <em>G</em> — the same point where medians <em>BE</em> and <em>CF</em> intersected.</p>
<p>Hence, <strong>all three medians intersect at the same point G</strong>, proving that the medians of a triangle are <strong>concurrent</strong>.</p>



<h3>Step&nbsp;3 – Proving the 2&nbsp;:&nbsp;1 Ratio</h3>
<p>By construction <em>AG = GH</em>. Because <em>GD = GH</em> (opposite sides in a parallelogram are equal), the whole median <em>AD</em> consists of three equal parts: <em>AG</em>, <em>GD</em>, <em>GH</em>.  
Thus <em>AG</em> is twice <em>GD</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-latex">AG = 2 \times GD</code></pre>

<p>The centroid <em>G</em> therefore divides every median in the ratio 2&nbsp;:&nbsp;1 (vertex&nbsp;→ centroid&nbsp;:&nbsp;centroid&nbsp;→ midpoint).</p>
