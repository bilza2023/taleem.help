Scene 01
========
Start from the stars at the top.
They are supported by a wooden structure whose outline curves inward, as if enclosing them.
The wooden path continues downward and leads directly into a central hub with a lightning-bolt symbol at its center, bordered by evenly placed crowns.
From this hub, the wooden path continues into the next scene, ending at two green cylindrical chambers.

Scene 02
From the two green cylindrical chambers, the path continues forward.
Each chamber is identical in size and shape, placed side by side.
The route then divides into two separate paths.

The upper path is made of red bricks, while the lower path is covered with green grass.
Between the two paths, people are worshipping, positioned evenly along the center.

At the end of the upper red-brick path, a lightning-bolt symbol is placed.
At the end of the lower green path, a pair of open hands is positioned.

Looking ahead, another identical set of green cylindrical chambers is visible, beginning the next scene.

From the same two green cylindrical chambers, the path continues forward.
Directly ahead, a vertical stack of cloud layers appears, arranged one above the other in two vertical columns.
There are seven cloud layers in total.

From this stack of clouds, two brick paths extend outward.
One brick path runs along the upper side, while the second runs below it.
Both paths are made of the same red bricks and move horizontally.

Along each brick path, blocked sections are clearly marked, interrupting the route.
The two brick paths then meet again at a single junction point.
A human figure is positioned next to this junction.

From the junction, the path continues forward as a single brick road, entering the next scene.

Scene 04

From the single brick road at the end of the previous scene, the path continues forward into a long horizontal section.
Above the path, a row of cloud icons is arranged evenly, forming a continuous layer across the scene.

Below the cloud layer, a line of light symbols is placed at regular intervals, aligned horizontally from left to right.
Each light is identical in size and spacing, creating a uniform sequence.

The brick path runs straight beneath these lights without splitting or branching.
No blocks or junctions appear in this section.

At the far end, the path continues directly into the next scene.
