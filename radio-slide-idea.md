# Radio Slide – Concept Note

## Purpose

Radio Slide is an **audio-first content format** designed to remove visual production friction.

It allows fast publishing of:

- Chapter summaries
- Concept reflections
- Clarifications
- Exam mindset discussions
- Professional depth talks

Visuals are supportive, not primary.

---

## Core Philosophy

1. Audio is the main content.
2. Visual must never demand attention.
3. No fixed timestamp sequencing.
4. Slide runs for a total duration (e.g., 300s).
5. Internal elements behave organically within that duration.

Radio Slide is **ambient reinforcement**, not structured teaching.

---

## Structural Identity

Unlike normal slides (which use `showAt` and deterministic timing),
Radio Slide uses:

- `from`
- `to`
- duration-based behavior

No strict content schedule.
No bullet sequencing.
No lecture-style progression.

---

## Visual Model (Layered but Limited)

Radio Slide uses controlled layers:

### Background Layer (Full Duration)

- Subtle waves
- Gradient drift
- Soft ambient motion

### Foreground Layer (Minimal Effects)

Limited to 4–5 primitives such as:

- Word cloud
- Ticker-style heading
- Keyword pulse
- Fade-in phrase
- Soft sliding title
- Light emphasis flash

Strict limitation prevents feature creep.

---

## Behavioral Rules

- Randomness must be bounded.
- Maximum simultaneous visual elements should be limited.
- Motion must be calm, not energetic.
- Silence periods (no visual activity) are allowed.
- Visual must feel incomplete without audio.

If the slide works without audio, it has failed.

---

## Usage Guidelines

Radio Slides should be used for:

- Summary of a completed chapter
- Common student mistakes
- Exam traps discussion
- Concept compression
- Professional insights (e.g., SQLite vs MongoDB decisions)

Radio Slides should NOT be used for:

- First-time explanation of complex topics
- Heavy diagram-based teaching
- Step-by-step problem solving

---

## Production Goal

Radio Slide must reduce friction.

If building or using it increases publishing delay, it contradicts its purpose.

Target build time: 4–5 hours maximum.

---

## Strategic Role in Platform

Core Decks → Structured learning
Radio Slides → Reinforcement & insight layer

Together they create:

Curriculum + Experience

This strengthens depth without slowing production.
